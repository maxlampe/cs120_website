    <h1>CS120: Introduction to AI Safety</h1>
    <h3>Autumn 2024</h3>
  </div>


  <div class="container sec" id="course">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>What is safe AI, and how do we make it? CS120 explores this question, focusing on the technical challenges of creating reliable, ethical, and aligned AI systems. We distinguish between model-specific and systemic safety issues, from examining fairness and data limitations to adversarial vulnerabilities and embedding desired behavior in AI. While primarily focusing on current solutions and their limitations through CS publications, we will also discuss socio-technical concerns of modern AI deployment, how oversight of intelligence could look like, and what future risks we might face.</p>
    <p>Topics will span reinforcement learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, focusing on interpretability, robustness, and evaluations. You will gain insights into the complexities and problems of why ensuring AI safety and reliability is challenging through lectures, readings, quizzes, and a final project. This course aims to prepare you to critically assess and contribute to safe AI development, equipping them with knowledge of cutting-edge research and ongoing debates in the field.</p>
    <p>This course has no official requirements, although we recommend some knowledge about machine learning and statistics.</p>

    <h3>Office Hours:</h3>

    <h3>Auditing The Class</h3>
    <p>You are welcome to audit the class! Please reach out to me (Max) if you want to audit the class to ensure we do not reach the capacity of the class room.</p>
    <p>Please note that auditing is only allowed for matriculated undergraduates, matriculated graduate/professional students, postdoctoral scholars, visiting scholars, Stanford faculty, and Stanford staff. After checking with me, please fill out this form and submit it. Non-Stanford students cannot audit the course. The current Stanford auding policy is stated here.</p>
    <p>Also, if you are auditing the class, please be informed that audited courses are not recorded on an academic transcript and no official records are maintained for auditors. There will not be any record that they audited the course.</p>

    <h3>Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</h3>
    <p>Violating the Honor Code is a serious offense, even when the violation is unintentional. The Honor Code is available here. Students are responsible for understanding the University rules regarding academic integrity. In brief, conduct prohibited by the Honor Code includes all forms of academic dishonesty including and representing as one's own work the work of another. If students have any questions about these matters, they should contact their section instructor.</p>

    <h3>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h3>
    <p>Much of the writing on existential risk produced in the last few decades, especially the notion of longtermism and its implications, has been authored by white male residents of high income countries. Diverse perspectives on threats to the future of humanity enrich our understanding and improve creative problem-solving. We have intentionally pulled work from a broader range of scholars. We encourage students to consider not only the ideas offered by various authors, but also how their social, economic and political position informs their views.</p>
    <p>This class provides a setting where individuals of all visible and nonvisible differences– including but not limited to race, ethnicity, national origin, cultural identity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, body type, socioeconomic status, veteran status, age, and religious, philosophical, and political perspectives–are welcome. Each member of this learning community is expected to contribute to creating and maintaining a respectful, inclusive environment for all the other members. If students have any concerns please reach out to Professor Barrett.</p>

    <h3>Students with Documented Disabilities</h3>
    <p>Students who need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: <a href="http://oae.stanford.edu">http://oae.stanford.edu</a>).</p>

  <div class="container sec" id="grading">
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Each week, students are expected to do the <strong>required readings</strong> and <strong>submit quizzes</strong>. Towards the end, students will need to submit a <strong>final project</strong> (later quizzes will adjusted and reduced in scope). Final projects can range from running experiments to writing literature reviews and policy recommendations to accomodate for different backgrounds. The grading breakdown is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>56%</strong> quizzes (half from completion, half from correctness)</li>
        <li><strong>33%</strong> Final Project</li>
        <li><strong>6%</strong> extra credit for unused late days (1% per late day)</li>
        <li><strong>5%</strong> Attendance bonus</li>
    </ul>
